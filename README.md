# Desciption
The my_printf project aims to replicate the functionality of the standard C library's     printf function. It's designed to format and print output to the console based on the provided format string and arguments.

# Task
The task involves implementing a custom printf-like function (my_printf) that can handle various format specifiers such as %d, %s, %c, %p, %x, %o, etc., and correctly format and display the output according to these specifiers.

# Usage
To use my_printf, include the my_printf.h header file in your C program and call the my_printf function with the desired format string and arguments through Makefile.

# Installation
To use my_printf in your project, place the my_printf.c and my_printf.h files in your project directory. Include my_printf.h in your source file where you intend to use the my_printf function.
